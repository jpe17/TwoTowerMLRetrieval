# 🚀 TwoTowerMLRetrieval Deployment Guide

## The Problem You Identified

You're absolutely correct! The original setup had a **critical deployment flaw**:

- `artifacts/` and `frontend/chroma_store/` are in `.gitignore`
- These directories contain essential model files and vector database
- Docker builds would fail because these files wouldn't be included
- Website deployments would crash on startup

## ✅ Complete Solution

I've created a **robust deployment system** that solves this problem:

### 1. **Pre-Deployment Validation** (`deployment_setup.py`)
- Automatically detects the latest trained model artifacts
- Validates all required files are present
- Provides clear error messages if anything is missing

### 2. **Dynamic Artifact Loading** (Updated `frontend/main.py`)
- No more hardcoded artifact paths
- Automatically finds and uses the latest model run
- More flexible and deployment-friendly

### 3. **Docker Volume Strategy**
- Artifacts and ChromaDB are mounted as **read-only volumes**
- Preserves data while keeping containers stateless
- Enables easy updates without rebuilding containers

### 4. **Automated Deployment** (`deploy.sh`)
- One-command deployment: `./deploy.sh`
- Validates prerequisites automatically
- Handles Docker operations with proper error handling
- Includes health checks and startup monitoring

## 🛠️ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Quick Local Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Ensure your model is trained and documents are indexed
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose
```bash
# If you have docker-compose installed
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Manual Docker
```bash
# Build and run manually
docker build -t twotower-retrieval:latest .
docker run -d \
  --name twotower-app \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "$(pwd)/artifacts:/app/artifacts:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/frontend/chroma_store:/app/frontend/chroma_store:ro" \
  twotower-retrieval:latest
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment (Web Hosting)

For production deployments on cloud platforms:

### 1. **Build Phase** (CI/CD Pipeline)
```bash
# In your build environment
python backend/main.py          # Train model
jupyter nbconvert --execute frontend/1_Index_Documents.ipynb  # Create ChromaDB
python deployment_setup.py     # Validate everything
```

### 2. **Upload Artifacts**
Upload the following to your hosting platform:
- `artifacts/` directory (entire latest run folder)
- `frontend/chroma_store/` directory
- Your application code

### 3. **Container Deployment**
- Use the provided Dockerfile
- Mount artifacts and chroma_store as persistent volumes
- Set environment variables as needed

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:

- [ ] ✅ Model has been trained (`python backend/main.py`)
- [ ] ✅ Documents have been indexed (run `frontend/1_Index_Documents.ipynb`)
- [ ] ✅ Docker is installed and running
- [ ] ✅ All required Python dependencies are in `requirements.txt`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No artifacts found"**
   ```bash
   python backend/main.py  # Train the model first
   ```

2. **"ChromaDB store empty"**
   ```bash
   # Run the indexing notebook
   jupyter notebook frontend/1_Index_Documents.ipynb
   ```

3. **"Docker build failed"**
   ```bash
   python deployment_setup.py  # Check what's missing
   ```

4. **Port 8888 already in use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in docker-compose.yml or docker run command
   # e.g., -p 8889:8888
   ```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Artifact Size**: Model artifacts can be large (100MB+). Consider:
   - Using `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
   - Implementing artifact caching in CI/CD
   - Using cloud storage for large models in production

2. **Security**: The deployment includes:
   - Read-only volume mounts for safety
   - Health checks for reliability
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Updates**: To update your model:
   ```bash
   # Retrain model
   python backend/main.py
   
   # Rebuild and redeploy
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## 🎉 Success!

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8888` with:
- ✅ All model artifacts properly loaded
- ✅ ChromaDB functioning correctly
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Production-ready deployment

This solution ensures your app **will work reliably every time** you deploy! 🚀
